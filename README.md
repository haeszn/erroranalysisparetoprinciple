## What the Software Does & Its Purpose
The Pareto-Based Linter is a static code analysis tool that helps developers identify and address programming issues efficiently. It follows the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to prioritize issues that have the most significant impact on code quality. This ensures that developers can focus on fixing the most critical issues first, improving maintainability and performance.

## Intended Market & Users
Python Programmers – Ensures code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.

Students & Learners – Helps beginners understand coding conventions and avoid common mistakes.

Educators & Coding Instructors – Provides an automated way to evaluate students’ code and suggest improvements.

## Basic Functions
The linter scans the codebase and categorizes issues into five main levels:

Refactor – Suggests improvements to make the code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

Convention – Ensures adherence to coding standards and best practices.

Warning – Flags potential issues that may lead to bugs or inefficiencies.

Error – Highlights definite problems that must be fixed for proper execution.

Fatal – Identifies critical issues that prevent the application from running correctly.

## Installation & Usage Guide
Step 1: Download the Pareto-Based Linter
Visit the GitHub repository.

Click the "<> Code" button.
Select "Download ZIP" and extract the files after downloading.

Step 2: Install Python & Dependencies

Download and install Python from python.org.

Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required packages using:
```
py -m pip install pylint
py -m pip install pandas
py -m pip install matplotlib
py -m pip install customtkinter
py -m pip install pillow
py -m pip install pyright
```

Step 3: Run the Linter

Open the extracted project folder in any Python interpreter (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE).
Run the application.

Step 4: Analyze Python Code

Click "Select Files" to choose a Python file for analysis.
Click "Run Analysis" to process the file.

The Pareto Chart will display the distribution of detected issues.
The lower-right panel will list line numbers, error codes, and detailed messages.

Step 5: Analyze Another File
To analyze a different file, click "Select Files" again and repeat the process.

#be sure to follow the comments on the codes to fully understand the code!#
